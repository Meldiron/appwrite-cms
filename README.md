## 👋 Introduction

Hey there 👋

Happy to see you here... Since you are looking for Appwrite admin panel, you already know what Appwrite is, right... Right?!?!

If you never heard about Appwrite, please check out [Appwrite website](https://appwrite.io/) to learn more about rapidly growing backend as a service. Believe it or not, you can't use Appwrite CMS without Appwrite 😬

With that said...

Prepare admin panels for your projects rapidly using Appwrite CMS, a headless CMS for your Appwrite project! ✨

Appwrite CMS is headless CMS for your Appwrite database. Appwrite allows you to manage your database and files, but the UI is too developer-ish and allows zero customization. In the end, it is a tool for developer not copywriter, so noone ever expected to use Appwrite as CMS.

**That's where Appwrite CMS comes into play!** Connect Appwrite CMS to your Appwrite project and configure it as much as you need. Appwrite CMS also allows you to write your own components to achieve any interface your project needs.

Thanks for your attention open source community! See you later in GitHub issues section 👋 😄

## 🤖 Generated Svelte Kit Docs

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
